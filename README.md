# Picrosser
A Simple Picross Solver

## Why I write this
I know there are lots of research on this problem have been done, and tons of picross solver have been made. But I am trying to do it by myself, to see how far I can get before I read research and others' program on th Internet. The reason are:
 - (MOST IMPORTANT) Nintendo's recent game, Pokemon Picross, is driving me mad! I want to solve those puzzle quickly, but still using my own thought. So I make a program helping me solve those puzzle. Since the program is written by myself, it's not cheating!
 - I am learning C# these days, so I write this in C# to get familiar with those syntax and librarys. And...
 - I just love coding :smile:


## Usage
For a Picross puzzle like this:

(Shoot from Pokemon Picross on my 3DS)

Type the following text into the text box:
```

5
3 1
3 2
3 2
3 3
4 1

8

1
1 1
2 1 1 1
2 3 1 1
2 2 1
2 2
```

Then press 'Submit Picross', and press 'Solve this', you will get the result:

At this point, the solver is far from finished - despite of the speed, there are even some picross puzzle that it cannot solve.
